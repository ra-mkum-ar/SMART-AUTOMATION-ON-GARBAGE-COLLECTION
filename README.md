Welcome to the SMART-AUTOMATION-ON-GARBAGE-COLLECTION wiki!

The detailed description of our idea is how to collect the waste plastic bottle which we can able to see in our day-to-day life places such as schools, colleges, and hospitals. So we developed the idea and started to execute it in a proper way. Moreover, we have seen so many ideas in our day-to-day life but now we can convey how our innovation differs from the existing one. First, we have said that the plastic bottle collector works on the mechanism of image processing. whenever the bottles are identified through the raspberry pi camera, it conveys the message to the collector bot so that the entire machine gets activated and works in progress. The bot is connected to the roller. One roller runs in a clockwise manner and the other in an anticlockwise. The bottles are identified the roller gets started and bottles are collected by conveyer belt. After the completion of the first process, the bottles are deposited in the bin with the help of a conveyer belt. Here the question arises of how it analyses the position whether it is horizontal or vertical using object detection in deep learning with the TensorFlow zoo model combines raspberry pi with the pi camera. Through the second process, we can be able to calculate the weight and count of the waste bottles using proximity sensors. These things are implemented for the survey report from that you can say that this machine can collect this much amount of waste. Then by the final process, if the leaves and tiny wastes are identified by the bot, the brush mechanism gets activated and starts sweeping which we are doing regularly in the home. For our convenience, we have implemented a small water tank which is the back side of the bin which gets activated when the places being found dirt, After that nozzle, gets opened and gets sprayed in the place. As every technology gets developed in our day-to-day life so by employing this innovation you can avoid Plastic pollution, Land and water pollution, Aesthetics, Traffic hazards, and Cost. So finally the complete process can be monitored by the mobile application which we uniquely designed.
